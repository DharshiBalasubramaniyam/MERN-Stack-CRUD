# CRUD in MERN stack

This is a simple todo web application to demonstrate CRUD operations in MERN stack.

The full form of CRUD is Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations that can be performed on data in a database or any persistent storage system.


- **Create**: This operation adds new data to the database. For example, adding a new record in a table.

- **Read**: This operation retrieves data from the database. For example, fetching records from a table.

- **Update**: This operation modifies existing data in the database. For example, changing values of an existing record.

- **Delete**: This operation removes data from the database. For example, deleting a record from a table.

These operations are fundamental to managing and manipulating data in a database, ensuring that users can interact with the data effectively.
